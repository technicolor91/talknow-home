                <p className="mb-4">
                  9.1 Applicable Law and Jurisdiction. Any dispute related to these Terms, their subject matter, and their formation, are governed by the laws of Singapore. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any question regarding existence, validity, or termination of these Terms, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
                  <br /><br />
                  9.2 Open Source. The App contains certain open-source software. Each item of open source software is subject to its own applicable license terms.
                  <br /><br />
                  9.3 Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and the Company and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and us.
                  <br /><br />
                  9.4 No Waiver. Our failure to enforce any provisions of these Terms or respond to a violation by any party does not waive our right to subsequently enforce any terms or conditions of the Terms or respond to any violations. Nothing contained in these Terms is in derogation of our right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Services or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use.
                  <br /><br />
                  9.5 Security. We do not guarantee that our Services will be secure or free from bugs or viruses. You are responsible for configuring your information technology, computer programs, and app to access our Services. You should use your own virus protection software.
                  <br /><br />
                  9.6 Severability. If any court of law, having jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms, and the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.
                  <br /><br />
                  9.7 Third-party Content. The Services may contain links to third-party content. We do not control, endorse, sponsor, recommend, or otherwise accept responsibility for such content. Use of any linked third-party content is at the user's own risk.
